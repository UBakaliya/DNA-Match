# DNA-Match
- A program for DNA matching and identification. A DNA matching program is a tool that can be used to identify individuals based on their DNA and determine the likelihood of a genetic relationship between two individuals. This type of program is commonly used by law enforcement agencies and forensic labs to identify individuals based on their DNA and solve crimes.

- The program works by comparing the DNA sample of an unknown individual with the DNA profiles of known individuals in a database. This is typically done by analyzing specific regions of the DNA, known as short tandem repeats (STRs), which are highly variable and can be used to distinguish one individual from another. The program uses algorithms and statistical methods to compare the STRs in the unknown sample with those in the database, and can determine the likelihood of a match with a high degree of accuracy.

- In addition to identifying individuals based on DNA matches, this type of program can also be used to determine the likelihood of a DNA match between two individuals, such as in cases of parentage or relationship testing. This can be done by comparing the STRs of the two individuals and calculating the probability of a genetic relationship.

- Overall, a DNA matching program is a powerful and effective tool for identifying individuals based on their DNA and determining genetic relationships. It is widely used in forensic science and law enforcement, and can provide valuable information in a range of criminal and civil cases.
